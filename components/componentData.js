      proposalTitle: "Implementing a Staking Mechanism",
      proposerName: "0x516...7239",
      proposalDetails: "This proposal suggests implementing a staking mechanism to incentivize participation and governance within the DAO. The proposed staking mechanism enables stakeholders to lock up their tokens for a certain period in exchange for rewards and voting power. By staking their tokens, participants actively contribute to the security and stability of the network while earning rewards based on their contributions. Additionally, the staking mechanism introduces a governance component that allows stakers to participate in decision-making processes by voting on proposals and protocol upgrades. Through the implementation of a staking mechanism, the DAO aims to align incentives, promote token holder engagement, and enhance the decentralization and sustainability of the ecosystem.",
